# Project 3 - Web API & Classification

### Forward
The goal of this project is to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to train a classifier on which subreddit a given post came from.
Within this repository, you will find a documented process for sourcing, cleaning, modeling, and evaluating data. The models and methods contained here are intended for use by a company trying to launch a new restaurant in the big cities in the United States. 


# Executive Summary

### Problem Statement
 A restaurant company requested General Assembly(G.A) Data Science team to help find the food trend in the big cities in United States by using reddit API. In this project, we will focus on data wrangling/gathering/acquisition, Natural Language Processing(NLP), and classification modeling to find the food trend.

### Dataset (two subreddits)

- [**r/foodnyc**](https://www.reddit.com/r/foodNYC) - 856 posts
- [**r/foodlosangeles**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Foodlosangeles) - 882 posts


### Project Workflow
1) [Data_Collecting](https://github.com/ggoo156/Project_3_Reddit_API_EC_WC_food_trend/blob/master/Project3-jupyter%20notebook/Project%203%20-%201.%20Data%20collecting.ipynb)
2) [Data Cleaning and EDA](https://github.com/ggoo156/Project_3_Reddit_API_EC_WC_food_trend/blob/master/Project3-jupyter%20notebook/Project%203%20-%202.%20Data%20cleaning.ipynb)
3) [Modeling_and_Evaluation with Count Vectorizer](https://github.com/ggoo156/Project_3_Reddit_API_EC_WC_food_trend/blob/master/Project3-jupyter%20notebook/Project%203%20-%203.%20Modeling%20and%20Evaluating%20(CountVectorizer).ipynb)

### Conclusion
- Overall quality, above ground living area square feet, and garage area are the features that has the high correlation with the sale price.
- Among the linear regression, elastic net performs the best for predicting Ames housing sale price.
