"Ep 1. Vietnamese pho with Pork ribs, Hello Saigon, Greenwich Village, NY","  

The Solitary Gourmet ‚Äì Ep 1. Vietnamese pho with Pork ribs, Greenwich Village, NY

‚ÄúWhatever their society, when a man indulges in satisfying his huger, he will become selfish and be liberated for a moment without being disturbed by anyone. To eat freely is an act of aloofness ‚Äì this act is the best comfort given to any man(Stalker,Nancy, 2016, Opening sequence of The Solitary Gourmet)‚Äù

This chilly fresh air, Christmas carols in CVS and my sour throat. It is definitely a holiday season.

I have a bottle of Doxycycline pills which I was prescribed for my sour throat, but, first, I need a bowl of Vietnamese pho which will comfort my throat and mind.

Ah, suddenly I am too hungry.

OK, let‚Äôs look for a restaurant.

Now my mind and stomach are being fully controlled by hot pho.

I will find the best pho even if I have to die to try.

Takumi Ramen, no thanks!

Go Go Curry, Pass!

Tipsy Shanghai, not today!

There is none at all. Why is there none?

Ah, See! There it is! Hello Saigon. 

The sign looks authentic. I‚Äôm counting on you today.

Whoa! ‚Ä¶ On the standing menuboard, they have a lot! phos, vermicelli noodles, even Banh mi‚Ä¶.This is definitely a Vietnamese place.

This is a miracle! 

Hey hey hey hey! Whoosh Whoosh Whoosh Whoosh. This is going to be good here.

They have lunch specials for 9 bucks! It is worth the walk. 

‚ÄúHi welcome. One?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease have a seat!‚Äù

Let‚Äôs check the menu.

Rice noodle with pork ribs. 9 bucks.

It‚Äôs making my mouth watering and the price is fair.

‚ÄúExcuse me, can I get a pho with pork ribs?‚Äù 

‚ÄúOh! Also, can I get the pork ribs on the side?‚Äù

Good job that I did not forget to order the ribs on the side so that I can enjoy the crispy ribs, not the ones soggy from the soup. It is very important. 

Hmm. It‚Äôs a quiet thriving shop. I love the chill, unpretentious vibe here. I am like in the night market in Vietnam.

By the way, what are these sauces on the table? Chilli sauce, sriracha of course and a black sauce. They look nice. 

I am so hungry by the way. When will mine come soon?

‚ÄúExcuse me, this is pho for you ‚Äú

Ehhhhhhhhh! They give me 3 dishes and they look overwhelming. 

I ordered just a pho noodle and they give one dish for carb &amp; broth, another one for protein and the other one for even greens? All for 9 dollars? I came into a huge windfall today! I feel that this is nutritionally complete. 

And look at these ribs. These grill marks! They are perfectly roasted on the grill. 

Hang on a moment. Let me count the pork because I want to distribute them evenly so that the pork is not running out before I finish the noodle. One two three four‚Ä¶ there are 7 pieces of pork ribs total. This dish alone can even be served as a meal. 

Now let me start eating soup first. Um, they serve hot hot hot soup. Some restaurants fail to serve the soup hot enough and I hate that. The broth should always be hot so that I can burn the roof or my mouth. Lukewarm soup, that is the worst.

Oh, I almost forgot that I should bury my greens and bean sprout in the ground of this bowl below the noodle coil before this soup loses its heat. I like the bean sprout half boiled to the extent it still has its crunchiness in the core. Also, I should not forget to squeeze the lime wedge and then bury it in the soup too. 

Let me start to eat the noodle first without the pork

(Slurping)

Woooow what is that. This honest broth with softly cooked rice noodles! UMAI! My sour throat does not have any difficulty swallowing it.

Then, let‚Äôs have noodles with a piece of rib. These thick plastic chopsticks are a little slippery but it is ok I can handle because I am an Asian! 

(slurping - my mouth full of noodle+soup+rib)  

Hooooo! This pork rib is for real. The savory smell of the fire instantly permeates the soup and the noodles. I am savoring the harmony of the flavors. They are pleasantly mixed in my mouth and making a perfect harmony. A large mouthful of food - It is such a great, satisfying feeling beyond compare. I do not think of anything now. It is a meditation.

Let me just have the rib alone. 

(Chewing)

Wooooow this rib! Moist, chewy inside and crispy outside. And this real fire smell. I especially love this chewy part of the thin membrane from the bone. And what is the seasoning they used? I taste some soy sauce and sweetness. It is similar to the Korean Kalbi seasoning or, I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ But it is clear that the ribs were well marinated and the protein is keeping the seasoning. This sweet soy sauce seasoning was partly burned when grilled, adding intense fire smell.

(Eating and Slurping)

Ah, my stomach is full. I cannot eat anymore. I ate all anyway.

(Waiving my hand for check)

‚ÄúAre you a student? You can get student discount with your ID if you pay with cash‚Äù

What?! The price is already reasonable and I can get an additional discount! Holy moly!

(Paid with cash)

Ah, it was such a good meal. I wish I were not sleepy in class. 

This was delicious‚Ä¶",1,4.0,0.0

Does anywhere in New York have authentic donair?,"I'm from Nova Scotia, Canada. We have a food there called a donair, which is basically a gyro or a doner kebab but not. It's hard to explain, but it's been my ultimate drunk food since before I could legally drink.

"I don‚Äôt know where else to post this, but I‚Äôve just had the best gyro of my life and I‚Äôve tried gyro from so many places","Gyro is one of my favorite foods. I‚Äôve been in NY all the my life and I spend most of my time in the city for school and work. I‚Äôve tried gyro from over 25-30 gyro carts. I‚Äôve tried so many because it‚Äôs the most affordable lunch you can get on a strict budget in the city. I‚Äôve probably tried 5-7 gyro places in Brooklyn and Queens, mostly from gyro carts. I just tried gyro from a store in Brooklyn. They‚Äôre actually a deli/grocer but they sell all sorts of foods. I was a little frustrated with them because their menu lists they sell samosas and fries, which is what initially came for but they don‚Äôt actually sell them. They make really amazing, fresh sandwiches too‚Äîespecially their Philly cheese steak hero sandwiches and chicken sandwiches. They‚Äôre also very generous and add whatever you like on your sandwiches. 

I just had gyro from them and I can‚Äôt contain and get over how good it was. The chicken was PERFECTLY seasoned and cooked. They add their own concoction of some special sauce, white sauce and hot sauce. The rice taste amazing. Usually when I get gyro the rice is pretty bland tasting and they attribute the great taste to the seasonings and lightly salting the rice. I highly recommend it if anyone‚Äôs looking to try freaking amazing NY food/gyro: KINGS EXPRESS DELI 1801 Avenue U. If you get a chance to try it, try it. There‚Äôs also another place I highly  recommend. It was my first favorite prior to trying it from this place. It‚Äôs in lower Manhattan by NYU. It‚Äôs a green cart on the northwest corner of Lafayette and Bleecker. The chicken is perfectly seasoned and cooked with green bell pepper, onion, carrots, and broccoli, and the rice is not too moist. The salad has tomato slices and lettuce and cucumber.

I made a giant spreadsheet of every dish from Buzzfeed's 'Worth It' series. Filter by city for NYC!,"Hello hello FoodNYC.

Earlier this year, around the same time that I moved to New York, I started watching the Buzzfeed series 'Worth It'. In the first season most of the restaurants featured were in LA but in the second season they started to explore places in NYC. I'm a sucker for a spreadsheet project so I decided to catalogue all the restaurants they tried. Say what you like about BuzzFeed, but Steven and Andrew seem genuinely lovely and the format for 'Worth It' is great‚Äîhearing about the history of each place and watching them create a dish adds a new level of appreciation for the food.

Anyway, here's the [Google Sheets link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Nby6OVTT8M9RtbrvETIO84Lo8A9iBJs-eVSqXpr3ZDg/edit?usp=sharing). You can download a copy and filter by city to check out all the places in NYC. The restaurant names all link out to their websites. 

Some stuff to note:

* 'Episode Name' links to the episode but not to the specific part of the video for that restaurant. If this proves popular enough I'll add the timestamps in.
* Some places they had multiple dishes. If the dishes were the same price I kept them in the same row and commented in the 'Notes' that the price was per dish. Other each dish got it's own line.
* Outside of the main three restaurants, sometimes they had snacks between meals. Under price point, I list these as a 'Side trip'. I got pretty lazy with including these if they didn't show the restaurant name or price. 
* Steven and Andrew always vote on their Worth It winner but they typically ask their sound guy Adam for his choice, and in other episodes they also have guests or other crew members vote. I added a \* under 'Votes' for each person who picked that restaurant. Since some of the places they went had multiple dishes, I just copied the votes across to all the items unless they specifically called out one dish. 
* For now I've generically listed New York City for all NYC boroughs and LA for all LA counties. Again if this proves popular I'll add a new field to specify location e.g. Harlem, West Hollywood, etc. 

Any other thoughts and feedback would be appreciated :) ",1,11.0,74.0

Korean Fusion (NOT KTown),"As a korean who visits Korea for many months of the year, I basically never eat Korean food in NYC.

Apple Picking for Serious Foodie,"I know it's an old question, but I'm a bit particular. Hoping another foodie out there is likewise particular and has a recommendation or two.  Also, I can get a car easy enough, so driving isn't a problem. 

Particulars: do not care about family friendly, or other activities, would actually prefer a U-Pick orchard WITHOUT all the other stuff, as I'd rather avoid family crowds and small children everywhere.  I'm there to get apples I can't get in the city! Apple cider doughnuts and hot apple cider are a welcome option, as are any other late season produce they might or might not have pre-picked near the front.

MOST importantly, is the selection of heirloom/old apple varietals.  I would love to find an orchard that had a lot of old types you rarely/never find in the greenmarkets. I can get braeburns and empires at Union Square, but late season, good old storage apples like Winesaps, Ashmeads Kernel, Arkansas Black, Esopus Spitzenberg, Black Gilliflower, Yorks, they'd be worth driving up for! 

Bonus points if it's got a winery/cidery attached!",1,7.0,15.0

"Looking to transfer a resi for Eleven Madison Park on Saturday September 29th, anyone interested?","So I booked the wifey a birthday dinner at Eleven Madison on the 29th (5:45PM)  and it's looking increasingly likely we are going to have to cancel it (including getting hotel and flight credits as we live in Dallas but that's another story). When we visit we always single out a restaurant to be the high point, the first year was Per Se, last year was La Bernardin, it's our yearly splurge; this year was to be EMP.

Anyway, we already purchased the seating for EMP thru their reservation manager website Tock (never used them before this) on Aug 1 since they book up immediately, we can transfer the resi but if there are no takers we have to pay it whether we show up or not, fair enough, we knew that when booking but an option out would be greatly appreciated.

We contacted EMP directly and were given a generic response that they would see if they had other diners that could take the resi but that was over a week ago with no word so I'm assuming I have to transfer the resi myself through Tock, show up, or just take the loss of $700 (ouch).

Questions:

1 - Are transferring resis between diners through Tock a common thing, and if so is anyone looking for a date night resi at EMP on the 29th? :)

2 - Is this kind of post frowned upon in this sub? If so my apologies, the mods can delete it.

Carlye Hotel Spaghetti-Os Haunting me for YEARS,"Hi Carlye Hotel,

I had dinner at your hotel 15 years ago. I asked for a vegetarian meal. The kitchen said no problem, they would cook something up. They brought out Spaghetti-Os (literally Spaghetti-Os, from a can), put cold steamed julienned carrots on top, and charged me about $100. Then had the nerve to ask if I wanted fresh pepper on top.

This is literally the worst meal of my life. Worse than eating Spaghetti-Os with steamed carrots in my own house. Mostly because I would only have to pay $1 for this meal at home, not $100. But also because, damn, I would have at least spiced that abomination up. 

I still haven't forgiven you for that Spaghetti-Os meal, Carlye Hotel. I still have the tinny taste of regret in my mouth, all these years later. It has made me refuse all ""o"" shaped food. I've missee out on years of donuts and Cheerios because of you. I don't understand why Spaghetti-Os sauce has no texture and why it is a little bit orange. I also don't understand why you didn't have the decency to at least serve me $100 Chef Boyardee or some $100 Kraft Mac and Cheese or even some $100 Bagel Bites. This fucked up meal and my failure to bitch about it has HAUNTED me for 15 years. 15 YEARS.
My memory of your establishment will always be $100 Spaghetti-Os with an uncomplimentary vegetable on top. 

I don't care if Ron Howard makes babies in you. I still hate you. You all can take those $100 Spaghetti-Os and shove them up your two-bit Spaghetti-As.",1,7.0,38.0

Multiple NYC food questions!,"We decided on 1 expensive dinner with the rest being fairly cheap meals. Hoping to find some very cheap options like pizza or hole in the wall places but also 1 or 2 nicer places that have entrees for 30 dollars or less. 

I plan to splurge on desserts. You know all those desserts that are featured on the INSIDER videos on facebook? That's what I want. I HAVE to try the ice cream with cereal blend but I'd also like to try at least 2 other dessert places. Last year I had an ice cream sandwich from a Melt stand and shaved snow at Grace Street Cafe. Both were very good. Along with the cereal ice cream I would be interested in finding a good place that sells a good Matcha or Ube dessert as I've never had either.

Just 2 more questions, thank you for your patience! 

Are there any good places that serve lamb for a reasonable, bordering cheap price? I am picky but I have always wanted to try lamb. I've noticed it on a lot of NYC menus but I don't want to break the bank in case I'm not a huge fan.


Last question. Have you ever been to Lincoln Square Steakhouse? That is where we are having our ""expensive"" dinner which actually isn't too expensive at all, considering many dishes are served family style and we have a groupon that's 80 dollars for a 3 course meal for 2, including wine.

Pretty much, whenever I am at the supermarket I am usually buying a 12-pack carton of supermarket brand seltzer water (or club soda, depending what is on sale).

I would have never imagined I would one day be drinking seltzer water or club soda regularly.  When I was young, I could not understand who in fact drinks the stuff.  But, now, I am the one who drinks this stuff!  I love it.

My SO and I are new to New York so we don't know many restaurants yet. I was hoping someone could give me some great valentines recommendations.

She seems to like fun adventurous menus, she loves the magazine ""bon appetit"" (if that helps ha) and is big on Asian food.  

Last year we ate [here](http://www.parachuterestaurant.com/) in Chicago which she loved. She also likes to get brunch at Dimes in Chinatown. 

 I'm hoping to find a romantic place and keep it around $100-150 per person. Brooklyn is a plus.

Thanks in advance! ",1,11.0,4.0

Advice needed for SO's birthday dinner,"My gf and I have an ongoing tradition of taking the other out to a nice restaurant for our birthdays (very original, I know).  Hers is a little more than two weeks away, and unfortunately it falls on a Friday this year, so I really need to make a decision quick and hopefully reservations will still be available at my top choices (damn my procrastination).  


I'll give as much info as I can to help with recommendations. Our previous dinners have been at:


-Tamarind

-Aquagrill

-The Eddy

-Marea

-Blue Hill

-Gunter Seeger


It does seem like our choices have trended towards outdoing the other on price, lol. That being said, I would prefer to pick a place no more expensive than Gunter seeger, ideally below that, but I may be willing to go somewhere a little pricier. 


While all the places have been excellent, I would say our favorites have been the Eddy and Aquagrill. Personally, the atmosphere was a bit much for me at Gunter Seeger, and for the price, I enjoyed the food/style of dishes at the Eddy and Aquagrill more than those at Seeger and Blue Hill (although the vibe at Blue Hill was awesome). Food at Marea was excellent, but I wasn't too keen on the atmosphere there either (huge, loud dining hall).  


Other notes:

-Ideally the place would be in Manhattan, but would be willing to go to the closer neighborhoods in brooklyn. 


-This one is pretty important. One of the things we really try to do finding a place is avoiding low hanging fruit (gramercy tavern, minetta tavern, gotham bng), household names (per se, le bernadin), or places we've discussed potentially going to (obviously this one you wouldnt know, but in the past we've discussed blue ribbon brasserie and babo's - off the top of my head).  


-Related the last point, but new places (last year or so) are definitely preferred options, but it doesn't have to be new. Small to medium size places are also definitely preferred. 


Open to almost any cuisine type (I've been considering a sushi place this year, but haven't made up my mind), but if it helps, our favorite restaurant is probably this place in Durham: http://mateotapas.com/menus.htm


Thanks!

Choosing between tasting menus for our one big (baby-less) outing of the year - any suggestions?,"My partner and I have decided that for this Christmas, our gift to each other is one night out, minus kids, with really, really good food. 

We have tried one tasting menu in the past (the Market Place in Como) and were blown away by the variation and experimentation. We'd love to do a good, varied, and interesting tasting menu in NYC for our night out...but there are so many options out there that I wanted to ask for people's advice on this sub.



What are folk's favourite tasting menus in Manhattan? (sorry Brooklyn, but you are too far on the train)



Some notes:

- I'm a vegetarian, which is limiting. Doesn't mean we have to go to an exclusively veggie place, but does mean that a meat-heavy or exclusive place is off the menu.

- At or under $100 per person is our limit, with some movement

- Less fancy is better. I almost always have baby throw up in my hair.

- I'm personally a fan of ALL food, but am feeling new American or Italian styles for the night. Open to all suggestions though.

West Coast Canadian in NYC Oct 29-Nov 5 looking for a local food spirit guide,"**TLDR: Canadian Tourist looking for NYC local to eat with while visiting**

First, I apologize to the mods if this is against the rules in any way.  I am not sure if there is a more appropriate place to post this.

Late October/Early November I am going on a 3 week journey to the US to make progress on my bucket list.  The journey includes a trip to LA for ""#21 Go to Disneyland as an adult"", and Vegas for ""#9 Win a hand of poker in Vegas with a Bluff"", but  I have recently added a week in NYC because of ""#16 see a live UFC fight.‚Äù  Also on my list are numerous food related goals.   For NYC, in particular, I am looking to ‚Äú#33 Eat a slice of folding NYC pizza‚Äù, ‚Äú#145 Eat a NYC Bagel‚Äù, ‚Äú#146 Have a NYC Hot dog‚Äù, and most importantly, ‚Äú#41 Eat a meal prepared by a world renowned chef‚Äù


Why does that bring me here?   Food is always best shared with someone.  Eating food alone is something I am prepared to do, but if I can find a person/people to share it with my journey will be far more enjoyable.    I come here to /r/FoodNYC seeking a NYC food spirit guide.  Take me to your favorite places to eat and share your city‚Äôs culinary wonders.  You get meet a new friend from far away and share a laugh, a drink, and hopefully some salty sweet goodies.


**Who I am:**
I am Chris, a mid-30s professional from Victoria, BC Canada.  I am passionate about food, old music, travel, fashion, my bulldog, and meeting new people.  I am not pretentious, very friendly, and definitely interested in hearing your story.


**Who you are:**
You can really be anyone!  If you are friendly and want to share some of your time and knowledge with a stranger simply out of kindness, you are an ideal candidate.  I do not discriminate on age, gender, orientation, race, economic circumstances, religion, or favorite Game of Thrones house.


**The Etiquette:**

-To keep things reasonable for each party we will each pay our separate bills.  

-I am OK with sharing food, but if you aren‚Äôt, that is also ok!

-You can offer as much or as little of your time as you like.  

-There is no pressure to stay.  Like meeting any stranger if either of us is uncomfortable with the meeting an eject seat button may be pressed

-Initial meetings can take place at the restaurant, or anywhere/time before hand.
(open to any suggestions on your end too)

-Each person is responsible for adhering to the dress code/rules of the restaurant.


**My Bucket list:**

-NYC Pizza

-NYC Hot Dog

-NYC Bagel

-Meal Prepared by World renowned chef (Currently thinking Dan Barber @ Blue Hill, but would be OK with another Michelin star level restaurant, if you prefer).  This one will take at least a 1 month advance reservation so we would need to make a reservation in the near future before ever meeting in person.  

-Drink an alcohol older than I am (Flat Iron Room?)

-Open to other suggestions! 


If this kind of thing is appealing to you feel free to shoot me a PM or respond on here.  Alternatively, if any of you reading this happen to visiting Victoria in the near future and need a spirit guide, I am more than happy to offer my services.

To get those results I compiled 11 somewhat recent lists of NYC's best soup dumplings, then removed the ones outside of Manhattan (personal reasons). The sites/lists were all given equal weight, and the restaurants which appeared only 1 or 2 times were removed. This was all done with a pivot table in Excel.

The lists used: Gothamist (2016), Time Out (2016), Vogue (2017), Quartz (2016), Grub Street (2016), Serious Eats (2011), Zagat (2014), CBS (2012), Chowhound (2013), Eat Your World (2017), and Yelp (2017). Sorry they are not linked but if you google the publication name and soup dumplings NYC you'll find it.

Limitations: Some of these lists are the opinion of a single editor, some are several years old, some were not clear how they ranked the dumps, and Yelp ranks the restaurants as a whole. Price was not considered (#1 is also the most expensive, by far). Many of the lists seemed to hate on Joes Shanghai just because it is popular and widely considered the best. Lastly, this is just Manhattan, and the best soup dumplings in NYC are probably in Flushing.",1,6.0,24.0

Any suggestions for a Unique Tasting Menu or Unique Dining Experience with advanced reservations?,"Hello r/FoodNYC!
The wife and I are visiting your beautiful city in early August and I am trying to find a unique (and good) restaurant with a tasting menu or a unique dining experience for us to try while we're in town.  

We are planners through and through and want to make sure we get a solid place reserved as soon as possible.  What I'm finding out though is that many of the restaurants we had on our list only take reservations 1 month to 6 weeks out...And we're not even sure if the restaurants we've listed are any good.

The ones we have on our list, are (in no particular order):

* Aquavit

* Le Bernardin 

* Aska

* Eleven Madison Park (possibly too pricey)

* Degustation

* Momofuku Ko

* Del Posto

* Contra

* Barbuto

* Per Se

* Agern

* Babbo

* Cosme

* Chef's Table @ Brooklyn Fare

So, I guess I'm looking for suggestions or feedback on this list (should some of these be taken off? Any others to add?) and any specific restaurants that you would recommend that would reserve as far in advance as early August?

It seems that the nicer / more popular restaurants don't need far advanced reservations since they're in high-demand, so should I even be trying yet?  I don't even know...I'm a bit of a clueless mid-westerner when it comes to this type of stuff. 


**TL;DR**  Please help a somewhat clueless mid-westerner figure out where to take his new wife for a unique dining experience in early August.  ;)


**Thanks for any help you can give!**

I know requests for help in these types of subreddits can be a bit annoying, but hopefully my list and any additional comments helps add to the community.

When evaluating restaurants, I'd say value is the biggest driver of experience for me when going to an expensive restaurant. I feel taken advantage of when portions are bite-sized, emphasis shifts to the crowd, or the chicken nearly hits three figures. I put a lot of weight on the natural wine selection and originality of dishes.

Best Specialty Markets in NYC?,"I cook a lot and have had a wonderful time exploring specialty markets in the city. I figured i'd share my favorites but also solicit suggestions of your favorites as well!

My few favorites:

[Kalustyan's](https://www.yelp.com/biz/kalustyans-new-york-2): Pretty much anything you'd want is here. A huge selection of cooking oils, spices, teas, dried beans and grains, flours, asian ingredients, fresh ramen noodles, dumpling wraps, curry leaves, lemongrass, even modernist chemicals. However, I got sick from their deli counter and I find their cookware to be overpriced (the place is a bit pricey generally). I love it because it makes cooking from specialty cookbooks a possibility. 

[Buonitalia](https://www.yelp.com/biz/buonitalia-new-york-2) in chelsea market. A not-as-fancy eataly with a great selection of specialty Italian ingredients--particularly good cheese and cured meat selection. Picked up a few specialty pizza and pasta flours there that I haven't used yet, but can't wait to put into action. 

[Di Palo's](https://www.yelp.com/biz/di-palos-new-york) I have a love hate relationship with this place, because it's awesome, but it's also super touristy on the weekends and the service isn't the quickest. Old school italian meat and cheese shop--I bought some truffle pecorino romano there that I use all the time.

[Eataly](https://www.yelp.com/biz/eataly-new-york-8). Eataly feels an overpriced tourist trap during the weekends, but on weekdays, it's actually a pretty dope market. I wouldn't get the meat (super expensive) but the vegetable butcher is good, and its' fun if you're an olive oil nerd and want to try out a lot of different kind of oils and vinegar. The fish market is also super good if you're willing to drop a bit of cash (My fiance loves bottarga and uni).

It's an unpaid internship and I'm a college student, so **I'm far from rolling in cash**. I'm looking for a grocery store (preferably small Japanese, but I suppose any will do if I'm desperate) with CHEAP sushi (like, **50c per piece** cheap) to pick up on my way to work. I need those nutrients, but I can't afford most places. I found this great place on 7th St - ""Grab &amp; Go"" - that's wicked cheap, but it's too far from the office.

I welcome sit-down place recommendations (for the future) if you have any, but it will be a while before I can go to them because tipping and time and everything is just too much.

Thanks so much, guys!

**TL;DR: Broke college student needs CHEAP sushi to-go. I get off at Grand Central and take the 7 to 34th Hudson Yards, so anywhere along/near any of those stops or GCT itself.** I'm also open to Harlem-125th area.

Restaurant review: Emily loves pizza (brooklyn),"went with 4 friends for a leaving-nyc-forever meal... normally i wouldnt have considered going.

One of us arrived at 12:10 (they open at noon) and put in for a table for 5. We were told the wait would be an hour and 45 mins. They text when the table is ready.

We went across the street and had some beers and everything was fine. I think we ended up getting the text around 1:30, so the wait was about 1:15 vs the 1:45 estimate.

Now onto the food:

We got 3 pizzas. classic margarita, one of the ones with tomatillo, and one nontraditional one that had some honey and pistachios (sorry i'm not more helpful with names).

Classic margarita was medium at best. It was somehow very salty, much saltier than it should have been. Not inedible, but just kind of off and not great.

The tomatillo was the best thing I had there. It was pretty simply (tomatillo sauce, cheese, we added banana peppers, and chorizo) but it was very very good. 

I didnt have the 3rd pizza (allergic to pistachios) but the people that ate it called it interesting rather than good.


Now onto the main event - the emmy burger.


I was underwhelmed.


Again, I thought it was somehow much too salty, and just not notably great in any regard. The ingredients balanced in an appropriate manner but there was just absolutely nothing about it that made it a $26 burger. I guess the only positive is that the $26 burger (which comes with fries) is of a sharable size, especially if you have other bites before hand.



So in conclusion - it is absolutely not worth the wait. Pizzas ranged from OK to very good but i'm sure equivalent/better can be found elsewhere without the hour and a half wait. The burger was extremely overrated and did not impress me versus other notable NY burgers I have had.",1,6.0,8.0

Turntable Chicken Jazz review,"I went here with a party of 8 this week.  I recommend making reservations for a large party- we walked right in and sat down at precisely the time we arrived.

The space is dimly lit and a bit loud, and the seating isn't that comfortable on the larger tables.  Don't bring your grandma here, but do bring a large group of friends who don't mind a little asses to elbows.

Turntable is particularly known for their Korean double-fried chicken wings, which come 10-20 pieces for 22.95 depending on drum or wing. They come in two flavors, spicy and soy garlic, and both are delicious. Get a half and half plate.  The food is predominantly deep fried  although they do offer some ramen and fried rice as well.  Definitely check out their fries and hushpuppies, they do a really good job with all the fried items.  

The chicken is expertly fried, it's puffy and crispy almost like a puffed rice cereal and perfectly seasoned.   It takes about 30 minutes to prepare, so you should be ready with your chicken order even before appetizers.

They serve both soju and beer in large formats, soju is $20 or $38 for 0.5L or 1L, 7-8 beers are served in this crazy dry-ice loaded LED color change tower for $48.

Our total bill for 8 was $340 for a 50 wings, some appetizers, and 2 rounds of soju and beer,  grat included, so eminently reasonable.

Pok Pok NY (Brooklyn),"This is a Michelin starred Northern homestyle  thai place on the west edge of Brooklyn.   My understanding is this restaurant originated in portland oregon and later expanded to NYC.  A little bit confusing yelp review history with alternating ones and fives.  

I think it's more towards five.  /u/wingsta previously recommended the fish sauce chicken wings and I can confirm they are excellent. We got the spicy, picture to come shortly.

We also had the flank steak salad with fried garlic, crispy chives, cilantro and mint.  This is unlike any typical thai you may be familiar with in other American Thai restaurants.  It's completely different and both rich and fresh at the same time.

We also got the environmentally friendly prawns with glass noodles and pork belly.  These shrimp are raised in NY thus freeing you from concerns of an ethical or environmental  nature.  Equally good as the flank steak but in a different way.  

The only loser of the night was the Brussel sprouts.  The wife and I are huge fans of the sprout, but these were improperly trimmed, underdone, and not properly caramelized.  The waitress tells me the eggplant is very strong, so perhaps go for that instead.

For cocktails, I got the mango alexander with mango vodka cream and lime.  Very rich but very delicious.  The wife got the lavender Tom Collins, we can't recall exact name.  Refreshing but imo mine was better.

Best Afternoon Tea in New York?,"Hi folks, 

I'm visiting New York in three weeks to spend some time with a girl I met there just before Christmas. Being British, we are planning to do afternoon tea when I'm there. Taste of Britain and all that.

I've had a look on google and found some suggestions; the one that keeps popping up is this place:

I've made a reservation but I wondered if there were any places that I might be missing that might be worth a visit? I'm not interested in any tourist traps or anything too fancy; like the quirkier the better. Also, if they do an afternoon tea with booze then that's an added bonus.

Authentic Beijing ZhaJiangMian in NYC?,"Hi,

Are there any Chinese restaurants that serve authentic Beijing Styled Zha Jiang Mian?  I don't want to Korean kind or the kinds from other Chinese regions.  I know some Sichuanese/Cantonese restaurants have their own Zha Jiang Mian.  And I know about the one served in Xian Famous Foods.  But I'm specifically looking for Beijing styled Zha Jiang Mian.

I've tried it a lot of places, and I have never found a place that made it right.  Most Chinese restaurants here just serve some cheap spaghetti dish when I order this.  The noodles are always too thin, and the sauce is always too watery. 

Also when this dish is served in Beijing, all the vegetables and sauce are served on the side.  And it's up to you to mix it up and add however much sauce you want. This isn't too important, but if any place serves it like that, it would be nice.

We are a couple of graduate students working on our bachelor project, which is about getting a broad variety of quality food at low prices, whilst preventing food waste. We are really passionated about our project, and since this is a food based sub-reddit, we were wondering if you would help us out!

We are trying to evaluate whether or not our service is well received in the States. To get a better understanding of this we have made a survey with a few questions regarding people‚Äôs eating habits and how they make their food choices (this will only take 2 minutes to answer).

Stout is located in downtown Santa Monica, this place is very cozy and has a good vibe, everybody is smiling, service is really good, staff is very attentive. I was sitting with my burger for a little too long and they got worried if everything was alright with it. No, it wasn‚Äôt alright, it was amazing.

&amp;#x200B;

They offer 50% off on food on weekdays from 4 to 6 pm.

&amp;#x200B;

Stout is one of my favorite places to get a good burger from. Their burgers have a very unique flavor.

&amp;#x200B;

I had a truffle burger, customized it a little. Instead of $14 - I paid $7 for that ambrosia. Love it. Love it. Love it.

&amp;#x200B;

I don‚Äôt recommend - I say: ‚ÄúGo there and get that burger!‚Äù

Usually, I'd say just make yourself hot cheeto mac at home since it's super easy to do yourself, but I definitely do not think I can replicate this!

Back to School Nostalgia Food Tour in DTLA on 9/29.," 

Hey fellow foodies: I‚Äôm helping to organize this event: `Back to School Nostalgia Food Tour` in DTLA on 9/29.

This time of year makes us nostalgic for the foods that filled our lunch boxes and childhoods. So on¬†September¬†29th,instead of ""back to school"",¬†[Avital Tours](https://avitaltours.com/los-angeles/)¬†is going ""old school""-from pot-pies to pop rocks.

We've created a¬†culinary experience¬†that celebrates childhood favorite foods, elevated. Our 4-course experience visits four restaurants in Downtown Los Angeles with a sprinkling of culinary history and stories in between. Each stop will have a tasting, complete with the stories of each restaurant, from a local guide.

"Anybody use Zomato, SynchroLife or any other Food review apps to find restaurants.","I get it that most people here use Yelp and I think it has its place but lately I feel like I've been stepping on too many restaurant landmines with too many 4-5 Star restaurants that are anything but that. It's especially bad when it comes to any kind of Asian restaurant or Thai restaurants. Whenever I go to a new neighborhood I typically start sorting filters to $ and $$ then by rating or by number of reviews or by Yelp elite members but the fake review landmines are increasing in number. Trip advisor is my 2nd best app but they don't specialize in food either so it's hard to find gems anymore. Wondering how you guys are finding your secret restaurants. Ones that aren't on any top 10 lists. 

Urbanspoon got bought out by Zomato but they seem to mainly focus in India so I'm trying to decide if it's worth my effort to build up their database.

Going for sushi tonight. Katsu - ya tongiht.

I want this to be very special and I am looking for a nice romantic restaurant with a fantastic view. She has mentioned that she wants seafood so I was thinking of something of that nature although it is not required. I want to seriously indulge without breaking the bank as well so I was thinking somewhere in the $400 - $500 area including a very generous tip. I was thinking about taking her out anywhere around 7 - 9 pm so if that helps. I was thinking about maybe a nice oceanside restaurant but I'm a little hesitant cause those seem to me to be more of a restaurant for lunch due to the view. I feel as if when the sun goes down you will be missing out on the ocean view. Thoughts?

I'm going to make it an all day thing with her and want to take her to a nice breakfast as well around the $100 ballpark.

I ended up going to the roof on Wilshire which unfortunately did not have bottomless mimosas but instead had a mimosas for $18 a carafe upon entry I realize that it was obviously on the roof of the Wilshire Hotel with a pool in the very middle it was very fancy and the tables and the setup was very nice although I was a little upset that my only View was that of cranes constructing the nearby buildings I was also upset that all of the glassware with the exception of the utensils and plates was all plastic I have never wanted to cheer somebody with the glass so much in my entire life then I did on that day I was sad at a makeshift Booth that's at 5 comfortably on cushion seats that I could have easily taking a nap on they were very comfortable the service was kind of slow but we were in no hurry so it did not bother me some as a group we ordered the French toast the tuna melt the parfait the pancake lasagna the scramble and the egg sandwich I fortunately had the pleasure of being allowed to try all items and can say I was not disappointed with any of them of those six dishes I would definitely recommend the tuna melt once we received the bill if I can recall correctly I believe it was around 1 50 or 160 we left an even $200 for a 25% tip which is very good based on what we ordered and I would highly recommend this restaurant for brunch.

Goodbye for the winter orange watermelon...I will long for your SWEET embrace,"Don't judge a watermelon by its cover.
http://i.imgur.com/g0X6zjk.jpg
http://i.imgur.com/cPrYuWq.jpg

It is with the same bittersweet mixture of foodie angst and relief that I welcome the end of the So Cal summer and my corresponding 3 month long farmers market binge.  During this season if it is juicy, colorful and from the farmers market I buy it, no questions asked.  Have I been known to compulsively buy farmers market delights and then give them away to complete strangers during the summer? Maybe...all I have to say is ""Thank God"" most of my favorite foods are seasonal or I could have a big problem.

Out of all 4 seasons, summer always produces the best food.  Last year it was Nectaplums (I still think of you, do you think of me?). Luckily this hot, Death Valley like heat wave burning it's way across Southern California coincided with my latest food obsession; orange watermelon.

Let me repeat that in caps, ORANGE WATERMELON!!!  Yes, watermelon can be orange and it can blow your mind if you give it the opportunity. Most importantly, the only place you can find one is at your local farmers market, which I did from a lovely Hungarian mother son team at Mar Vista Farmers Market. 

What are the 4 reasons why I love farmers market orange watermelon so?

Refreshing and sweet.  But a citrusy sweetness unlike any common red watermelon

Amazing flavor.  Mix watermelon with Hawaiian mango, tangelo and you got a mouth party.

Surprisingly boring and plain rind.  I love the spiritual lesson, ""Don't judge a watermelon by its cover"".

Circulation booster!  According to a National Institute of Health study The rind has citrulline a ""a natural and rich source of the non-essential amino acid citrulline [which]... has potential antioxidant and vasodilatation roles"".  That vasodilatation really helped me out during this hellish, pore draining heat wave.
Even orange watermelon knows ""love"" is the most important ingredient.  Look at the heart in it's flesh :)


Speaking of heat waves, why do Angelenos always act surprised that the thermometer is in the 80's and 90's hot in September when every single year we have late summers?  Get over So Cal, it is called an indian summer and they happen every year in this region.

Maybe this is the same type of seasonal amnesia that happens to Los Angeles freeway drivers when it rains and everyone loses their motor skills.  How do our foodie friends survive back on the east coast?

Let me know how you feel about the sauce, when you first encountered it, etc. Also let me know if there's anyone I should be in touch with. Finally, curious if anyone went to the Sriracha-Tapatio art exhibit at the Chinese American Museum since I missed it, and what you may have thought of it. Stay garlicky!

Anyway, having moved to the land of hipsters and crappy burritos, I've been tinkering with recipes to recreate that fiery goodness. I think I finally have something close. Portions are rough - you'll want to adjust to taste.

* 7oz Chipotle in adobo sauce (Goya)
* 1 New Mexico (or California) pepper (dried)
* 1Tbl Cayenne pepper
* 4Tbl Distilled vinegar
* 1tsp Lemon juice
* 1tsp Salt
* 1Tbl Black pepper
* 1Tbl Sugar
* Water

BTW, the adobo sauce has tomatoes, lemon, garlic, and onion, so I didn't see the need to add more.

Just a thanks to all you awesome redditors in this subreddit,"So thank to all of your suggestions for places to eat where I was traveling, food wise, the trip was a smashing success. From the list, here are places we ate:

Inn n Out - Not bad, not great. On the level with Wendy's in my opinion. 

Yugie - Had Shabu Shabu. Liked it a lot.

Korean BBQ - but can't remember what it was called. Really dug that as well. Wish places like this were out here in the East.

Joey's BBQ. The tri-tip was not as good as I had hoped. Was a little dry. But overall, nice place. 

Slaters 50/50 - WINNER WINNER. Man, I would visit this place weekly if we had one. The burger was awesome, and man, over 100 beers on tap. The place ROCKED.

85c Bakery. - Really liked that place as well. Would go back. My latte was no where near as hot as they claim to like to serve their coffee, but still good. :)

Bruxie Waffle Sandwiches - Not as good as I had expected, but an ok exp.

Not from the list, but we also ate at Tahoe Joe's Steak House. One of the best meals I ate while out there. I had Joey's signature Tri Tip steak, combed with some ribs. Was fantastic. 

And had a really good teriyaki steak dinner at the restaurant at the Holiday Inn at Diamond Bar where we stayed.

Had a really good burger at Larry's as well, right off the Venice Beach Boardwalk. Did not expect much from it going in, but was very pleasantly surprised.

I feel like I am missing a place or 2, if they come to mind I will update this.  But overall, great eats. I love the variety that is in the area, and not having to go downtown for that variety. Out here near Philly, you really have to go into the city for the great variety, out here in the burbs, we got pizza shops. lol. Love my pizza and cheesesteaks, but man, we need some of that Cali variety here out East.

Would anyone like to go with my high school food club to help spur discussion of what we're eating?,"We go out once a month. The system is that we all pool our money, order a variety, share the food and talk about it. I'm the faculty advisor (and founder, started it about 10 years ago) and I usually kick in money for a few extra dishes (it's just money). Our first trip every year is always to Cafe Sanamluang for Thai and then either Scoops or Pazzo Gelato for ice cream; that should give you an idea of what level of cuisine we're going with. I am no expert, I'm just a well-traveled teacher who likes helping kids try new foods.

Things go great until I try to talk about the food. The kids just have no experience with things like Thai food or ramen or Indian food or etc. They know burgers and fries and tacos. I ask 'can you taste the lemongrass in the soup?' and they look at me and nod; they have no idea what I'm talking about.

I am curious about what would happen if a food-savvy adult or two joined us and helped get the talking started. If you're interested, please let me know what cuisine(s) you're familiar with and we'll see what can be arranged.",0,6.0,10.0

What are some great outdoor patios in restaurants around LA?,"I loves me some good food, but I'm always searching for scenic &amp; quiet outdoor patios to go with it - like Cavatina (at Sunset Marquis), or the new AOC, or sitting at the edge of the pier at Malibu Farms Cafe. 

I've got a good list, but would love to know new ones if you've got'm.

Thanks!",0,7.0,9.0
